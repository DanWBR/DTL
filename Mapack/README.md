Mapack is a .NET class library for basic linear algebra computations. 

It supports the following matrix operations and properties:

  * Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction
  * Determinant, Norm1, Norm2, Frobenius Norm, Infinity Norm, Rank, Condition, Trace, 
  * Cholesky, LU, QR decomposition and equation system solver  
  * Single Value Decomposition, Least Squares solver and Eigenproblem solver

The algorithms were adapted from LAPACK and the Java Matrix Package.
